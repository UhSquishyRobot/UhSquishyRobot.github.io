  <h1>My Summer Travel Blog</h1>
    <p class="words">
    Last summer I traveled to Berlin, Prague, and Budapest.  I spent most of my time in hostels and meeting up with other travelers, but I spent two weeks staying with friends I knew from the US who were living abroad.  I stayed with one friend in Berlin and also with a friend in Budapest who was doing her Masters at CEU.

  <h3>Berlin Hydraulics Research Center</h3>
    <p class="words"> This cartoonish building seems like a piece of experimental architecture from the 20th century, but it is in fact a hydraulics research center!</p>
    <img src="images/Prague.jpg" alt="St. Vitus Cathedral"/>
  <h3>St. Vitus Cathedral</h3>
    <p class="words"> This incredible example of Gothic Architecture sits imposingly atop a hill within the Prague Castle complex, and is over a thousand years old</p>

  <h3>Hungarian Parliament Building</h3>
    <p class="words"> In person, the Parliament building of Budapest is an <strong>incredibly</strong> impressive sight.  It sits on the bank of the Danube river, across from the old Castle.  Tragically, it was the site of a bloody massacre in 1956 at an anti-communist demonstration.</p>

    <p class="words">For a look at a far more experienced travel blogger, click this link to <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/four-days-in-prague/">Nomadic Matt's Travel Blog</a>.  I've provided the link to his entry about Prague.
    Matt's blog is rad because it includes lots of good pictures, brief but useful and interesting information, and an abundance of links to relevant websites including a user forum for other travelers to communicate.  He has made good use of formatting elements to create distinct and orderly sections in the website which are clear and easy to navigate.</p>
