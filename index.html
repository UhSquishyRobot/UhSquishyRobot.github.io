<h1>My Summer Travel Blog</h1>
<p>
Last summer I traveled to Berlin, Prague, and Budapest.  I spent most of my time in hostels and meeting up with other travelers, but I spent two weeks staying with friends I knew from the US who were living abroad.  I stayed with one friend in Berlin and also with a friend in Budapest who was doing her Masters at CEU.
